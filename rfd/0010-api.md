# RFD 10 - API and Client Libraries

## What

- Unify Golang Client experience.
- Automatically generate API documentation using [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/).

## Why

There are several problems with the Teleport Go client libraries:

* The [Go client example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/5.0/examples/go-client) uses the teleport Go module as a dependency. This means that the example pulls in all of the teleport module's packages and indirect dependencies, leading to extreme import bloat.
* There is no separate client library with guarantees of compatibility with specific version of Teleport. See examples [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix).
* Some client logic is residing in [plugins](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/blob/master/access/access.go), while other logic is in `teleport/lib` packages.
* It's impossible to generate the library in any other language other than Go due to an unclear API surface.
* Code in `lib/auth` uses some concepts unfamiliar to Go users. For example, it deals with tls certificates at a low level:

```go
// connectClient establishes a gRPC connection to an auth server.
func connectClient() (*auth.Client, error) {
    tlsConfig, err := LoadTLSConfig("certs/api-admin.crt", "certs/api-admin.key", "certs/api-admin.cas")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to setup TLS config: %v", err)
    }

    // must parse addr list panics and is not necessary
    authServerAddr := utils.MustParseAddrList("127.0.0.1:3025")
    clientConfig := auth.ClientConfig{Addrs: authServerAddr, TLS: tlsConfig}

    // TLS client is the only client
    return auth.NewTLSClient(clientConfig)
}
```

## Details

A new `api` Go module will be made to expose existing and new API features. This will make it easy to import the API with a small import footprint. Users will be able to run `go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api` to get the latest version of the API and get started.

Teleport's internal gRPC Auth client will be moved into the `api/client` package and embedded in the old client for backwards compatibility. Over time, the internal client will be deprecated and replaced with the new public client.

Other logic such as the web client and tls/ssh certificate logic will be moved to the `api` package as well.

The new client will gain several new quality of life improvements, including credential loaders, automatic server version checking, better documentation, and more language implementations.

### Make independent api package

Move the API client and its dependencies to the new `api` package to keep Teleport's API layer unified.

`api` package file structure:
```
teleport/ 
└── api/
    ├── client
    |   ├── proto
    │   |   ├── authservice.proto
    │   |   └── authservice.pb.go
    │   ├── client.go
    |   └── webclient
    |       └── webclient.go
    ├── types
    │   ├── events
    │   |   ├──events.proto
    │   |   └──events.pb.go
    │   ├── wrappers
    │   |   ├──wrappers.proto
    │   |   └──wrappers.pb.go
    │   ├── types.proto
    |   └── types.pb.go
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ... utils, defaults, constants, and other limited api dependencies
```

#### Backwards compatibility

Use Go's type aliases to refactor code into the `api` package while maintaining backwards compatibility in the main `teleport` package. These aliases can be removed once the refactor is complete.

```go
// Preserve full backwards compatibility
type services.Role = types.Role
type auth.Service = proto.Service
```

#### Separating the API from `teleport` packages

Since `api` will be a submodule and depenency of `teleport`, it will cause an import cycle if `api` has any dependencies on `teleport`. However, `teleport` packages are all dependent on each other in a convoluted dependency graph, so one of the challenges of moving the API to its own module will be to sort out these dependencies.

The majority of code that needs to be moved to the `api` module is in `teleport/lib/auth/clt.go` and `teleport/lib/services`. The former will be largely extracted into `api/client` and the latter into `api/types`.

Any protobuf generated code relevant to the API, including `teleport/lib/events` and `teleport/lib/wrappers`, should be moved into `api`.

Code in some other package, such as `lib/constants`, `lib/defaults`, `lib/utils`, `teleport/lib/events` and `teleport/lib/wrappers`, will need to be extracted into to `api` module as well.

##### Minimize dependencies

Some logic found in these package will be beyond the scope of the external API and should be refactored to minimize dependencies and reduce the number indirect imports for API users. This will help to clarify the separation between api and business logic and make the client more language agnostic.

For example, in `lib/services/role`, `role.CheckAndSetDefaults` has some business logic that should remain on the server side. Therefore that logic should be extracted into a new function, `ValidateRole`, and kept in `lib/services/role.go` rather than `api/types/role.go`.

```go
// api/types/role.go
(r *RoleV3) CheckAndSetDefaults() error {
  ... basic validation with business logic extracted
}
```

```go
// lib/services/role.go
func ValidateRole(r types.Role) error {
  ... business logic
}
```

Some basic dependencies will be unavoidable:
  * `github.com/gravitational/trace`
  * `google.golang.org/grpc`
  * `golang.org/x/net`
  * `golang.org/x/crypto`
  * `github.com/stretchr/testify`

If the list of dependencies grows beyond 20 dependencies and indirect dependencies, this issue should be revisited for better tracking mechanisms.

##### Deprecate the `lib/auth.Client`

As stated before, all gRPC client related code will be moved out of `teleport/lib/auth/clt.go` and into `api/client`. Backwards compatibility will be maintained by embedding the gRPC `api/client.Client` in the internal `teleport/lib/auth.Client`.

Additionally, the remaining HTTP endpoints in the internal client will be converted and added to the gRPC client. To maintain backwards compatibility with old servers, the internal client will be updated to first try the new gRPC endpoint before falling back to the existing HTTP endpoint. These fallback methods will be moved to `teleport/lib/auth/httpfallback.go` and deprecated after one major release cycle.

There is [issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6394) used to track remaining endpoints that need to be converted to gRPC. 

Once all necessary endpoints have been added in gRPC and all HTTP fallback logic has been deprecated and removed, the gRPC client can completely replace the existing `lib/auth.Client`. At this point the underlying gRPC server will be the same, so the transition should be relatviley straightforward.

### api module

The api package will be made a sub module of teleport. It will exist in the `teleport/api`, and will be imported by the main `teleport` module through a go.mod [replace directive](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace) using a relative path.

Users will be able to get the latest api version by using `go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api`, or a specific version with `go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api@vX.Y.Z`.

#### versioning

Go module versioning must follow semver and can automatically be pushed with git tags. Since the api module is a sub module, its version tags will look like `git tag api/vX.Y.Z`.

If the module's version is above 2, it must follow the [v2+ Go Module release guide](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#releasing-modules-v2-or-higher) by appending a major version suffix to the import path. The import path for each major version `X` will look like `github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/vX`.

Note that if the git tag and other go module requirements aren't implemented, the api will be versioned as v0.0.0-[random-string]. Getting the latest version with `go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api` will get the most recent version in terms of time rather than semver/teleport version. For this reason it is important to release a proper public version as soon as possible.

##### Release option 1 - Release the API with each Teleport release

The API can be tagged for release as part of the existing Teleport release process. Each Teleport release will get both the `vX.Y.Z` and `api/vX.Y.Z` tags.

Pros:
 - Teleport Compatibility promise - The `api` module will follow [Teleport version compatibility](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0012-teleport-versioning.md#compatibility) just like `tsh` and `tctl`.

Cons:
 - Cluttered versions - Even when no API changes are made, there will be a new `api` tag and release.
 - Frequent major version bumps - The API will likely remain backwards compatibile for a long time once it is marked as stable (released at v1+). However major version bumps in semver imply backwards incompatibility. It would be better to avoid major version pumbs to simplify the upgrading process for users.
 - Major version suffix rule - The API would start at v2+, so it would have to follow the major version suffix rule.
   - `vX` must be appended to the `api` import path before each major version. This adds an additional release step that is cumbersome for frequent major releases, and can cause development issues such as merge conflicts for backports.
   - Users who want to update to a more recent client major version will have more manual steps; `go get` the new major version and then update import paths.

Although there are more Cons listed than Pros, the compatibility promise may outweigh any negative effects.

##### Release option 2 - Release the API separately from Teleport

The API can be released out of step with the main Teleport releases.

The API can start at `v0`, which implies instability. When we are ready to guarentee the API's backwards compatibility and stability, it can be upgraded to `v1`. I would suggest that we upgrade to `v1` once the old client is completely deprecated and the new client is used internally.

Once a breaking change is added to the `api` module, the major version will be increemented, and the import path will be updated with the major version suffix. Ideally, we would keep it in `v1` for as long as possible in order to avoid changing the import path on releases to include the major version suffix. API major versions will be a special case unlike current Teleport releases.

Pros:
 - Following Go Module conventions - Go users will have an easier time if we base our Go Modules on semver rather than our unique versioning guidelines.

Cons:
 - Compatibility - It might not be immediately obvious based on the client version what server/cli versions are compatible.
   - A [compatiblity matrix](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix) could be added to the docs and `api/client` to help reason about compatibility. 
   - One solution to this problem is to version the api as `v1.[teleport-major-version].[api-minor/patch-version]`. With this strategy, any `v1.M.X` Api version will work with any `vM.Y.Z` Teleport version.

### Client experience improvements

This is a list of quality of life improvments that will be added to the new api client. 

#### Go native user experience

The client user experience will be simplified with a new client constructor. The client constructor should be able to retrieve credentials during initialization and handle errors. It should also transparently handle dialing via a proxy if a proxy address or tunnel dialer is provided (along with valid ssh credentials).

```go
import (
   "github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client"
)

func main() {
  // TLS client is the only TLS client supported in teleport
  client, err := client.New(client.Config{
    Addrs: []string{"localhost:3025"},
    // ContextDialer is an optional context dialer
    ContextDialer: net.DialContext,
    // direct TLS credentials config
    Credentials: []client.Credentials{
      client.TLSCreds(tls.Config),
    }
  })
  ...
  defer client.Close()

  ping, err := client.Ping()
  ...
  fmt.Printf("Ping: %v\n", ping.Version)
}
```

```bash
$ go mod init
$ go run main.go
```

#### Credential providers

Support multiple credential providers:
  * `client.LoadTLS(*tls.Config)` loads creds from TLS config.
  * `client.LoadKeyPair("crt_path", "key_path", "cas_path")` loads creds from tls certificates.
  * `client.LoadProfile("profile_path", "profile_name")` loads creds from the users default or specified tsh profile.
  * `client.LoadIdentityFile("identity_file_path")` loads creds from an identity file.

Support tunnel address discovery from the web proxy, as well as tunnel proxy connectivity using ssh certificates. Since tsh profiles have ssh certificates and the web proxy address, LoadProfile should be able to load the client without any user input. The user can simply `tsh login` and then the client will retrieve their credentials. This mirrors the functionality that `tctl` offers.

```go
// for testing, use client spec that loads tunnel dialer and certificates from profile
client, err := client.New(client.Config{
  Credentials: client.Credentials{
    client.LoadProfile("", ""),
  },
})
```

```bash
$ tsh login
# try client
$ go run main.go
```

#### Automatically reload credentials

Credential loaders should detect underlying file changes and automatically reload credentials and update the grpc transport.

#### Automatically check server version

The client will automatically verify that its version is compatible with the server's version by calling `Ping` during client initialization, similarly to how tsh does.

The client will fail to initialize if the the versions are not compatible. The user can override this by providing `SkipVersionCheck: true` in `client.Config` to avoid blocking users that are in the middle of upgrading.

### Improve API documentation user experience

The API's documentation will be split into 3 parts:
 - Automatically generated [pkg.go.dev webpage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client).
 - [API Reference](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/api/) on the Teleport docs site.
 - In depth code [examples](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v6.2/examples/go-client) 

#### pkg.go.dev (godoc)

The majority of the API's documentation will be hosted on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client). This documentation is automatically generated from the package code upon each package release. Having code-centric documentation will make it easier to maintain and update. It will also improve the experience of working with the code both internally and externally.

In order to improve this automatically generated documentation, code comments throughout the api package will be made thorough and user focused. There are several useful [tricks](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluhus/godoc-tricks) to improve the formatting of the documentation, and even add runnable [code examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluhus/godoc-tricks#example-Examples).

In the beginning, only essential functionality for the client package will have exceptional documentation. For example, [client.Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#Credentials) and [client.New](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#New) will have an extensive explanation of it's usage with code examples. 

Any code added to `teleport/api` should be held to a standard of excellence in regards to documentation. Specifically, all added code should have user focused comments and examples. Older code will be updated to this standard of excellence on an ongoing basis according to demand/priority.

#### API Reference

Some documentation will not fit cleanly within the bounds of the code. Such documentation will instead go on the main Teleport docs page under the [API Reference](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/api/) section. This section also serves as an entry point to the generated documentation.

To begin, this documentation will have three sections:
 - Introduction: short summary, leads customers to relevant documentation.
 - Getting started: High level overview and guide to getting started.
 - Architecture: Covers in depth topics such as managing API authorization, client connections, and credentials.

More pages can be added here over time if needed, but the in-code docs should be prioritized.

#### Examples

The majority of code examples will be handled by in code [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluhus/godoc-tricks#Examples). However, some examples require more in depth explanations or combine several client capabilities into a full working example.

For now, there is only one example in the `teleport/examples` package
 - https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v6.2/examples/go-client

Once another example is to be added, they will be moved to `teleport/examples/api/example-name` in order to keep all examples in one place.

*spoiler*: The workflows example in `teleport-plugins/access/example` will be the first example to be added.

### Workflows

#### Deprecate teleport-plugins/access package

The `teleport-plugins/access` package was originally created in order to utilize the Teleport Auth API without being dependent on internal Teleport code. Now that Teleport has a public API, this is no longer a concern. Additionally, the access package only adds a few nonessential quality of life features over the `teleport/api/client` package.
 
  - Automatically append plugin name and other determinable parameters to relevant client methods. e.g. `GetPluginData(reqID)` calls `client.GetPluginData({types.KindAccessRequest, reqID, plugin.name})`.
  - Automatically filter and type cast access request events.
  - Rename, alias, or convert structs to be more user friendly for those who are only using access requests. e.g `types.AccessRequestV3` becomes `access.Request` which has a flat structure as opposed to `teleport.Resource` with metadata and spec structs embedded.

These benefits are minimal at best, and actually detrimental at worst. Specifically, users who plan to use the access client for access request management the API client for other functionality will need to learn two APIs when they only need to learn one. Additionally, the listed benefits can be handled with updated documentation and examples 

Another downside of the separate `access` package is that there are two separate clients to maintain, version/release, and maintain compatibility. This adds unnecessary strain and confusion for both maintainers and users.

The external plugins held in `teleport-plugins/access` will be updated to use the new client. Once this is complete, the access client can be removed, meaning its final version will be it's previous release. e.g. If we release the updated plugins in `v6.3`, The final version of the access client will be `v6.2`. `v6.2` would still be guaranteed to be compatible with teleport until `v8.0`, according to the Teleport [compatibility guidelines](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0012-teleport-versioning.md#compatibility).

#### Add workflow examples and documentation

In order to compensate for the removal of the `access` client and its qol features, the API client's documentation around workflows will be improved. User focused comments and examples will be added to all of the essential workflows functions, including the stream watcher.

Additionally, the [access code example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/example) will be refactored to use the API client and added to `teleport/examples/api`.

#### Provide simplified high level access hooks

Access hooks are too low level and require in depth knowledge of teleport and the API client.

High level access hooks will be added to a new `api/client/access` in the form of a simple handler similar to an http server with a router.

```go
func myTeamRequest(ctx context.Context, req types.AccessRequest) (types.AccessRequestUpdate, error) {
  return types.AccessRequestUpdate{
    RequestID: req.GetName(),
    State:     types.RequestState_DENIED,
    // I don't trust my team, automatically deny all requests.
    Reason: "No.",
  }, nil
}

func main() {
router := access.Router()
  ctx := context.Background()

  router := access.Router{}
  // handle access requests from my team only
  router.HandleUpdateFunc(myTeamRequest, MatchUserTrait("team", "myteam"))
  srv := access.Server{
    Client: clt,
    Handler: router,
  }

  // Watch for incoming requests and automatically handle
  // any that match a HandleFunc.
  return srv.Run(ctx)
}
```

##### Route Matching

The router will use composite keys to match a request to a route. Composite keys were chosen rather than a more complex `Matcher` interface solution due to how easy it is to compare composite keys. This strategy should be significantly simpler and more scalable.

```go
type Route struct {
	Handler HandlerFunc
	Keys    []CompositeKey
}

type CompositeKey struct {
	Kind  string
	Key   string
	Value string
}
```

Composite keys can be used to match several relevant values associated with a request, including `request.user.traits`, `request.user.labels`, `request.state`, etc. If more complex matching mechanisms (such as user definable `where` statements) are required in a future iteration, they can be added alongside `Route.Keys` struct and checked separately.

##### Matching Algorithm

Unlike an http server router, the access hooks server cannot route via a radix tree. An access request may match multiple routes based on it's values. For example, a request may have `user.trait=myteam` and `label.group=security`. If both of these values have their own handler, then the request will match both handlers, despite the handlers having no detectable overlap.

Since a simple tree-like solution is not an option, the router will instead loop over the routes available looking for a match with the request's associated composite keys. The first one to match will be used to handle the request, so it is important for users to consider handler priority. If needed, this solution can be improved by adding a graph traversal solution.

##### HandleFunc

HandlerFuncs should be high level enough to be easy to use, but shouldn't be so low level that they remove complex functionality. Below are three different types of HandlerFuncs that can be implemented, in order of highest to lowest level.

```go
// Automatically approve/deny the request based on the error. If denied, the error's message will be used as the reason.
type HandlerFunc func(ctx context.Context, req types.AccessRequest) (err error)

// Automatically send a client.UpdateAccessRequestState request using the update params returned. Allows more granular
// usage of the AccessRequestUpdate fields, such as annotation, roles, and reason. 
type HandlerFunc func(ctx context.Context, req types.AccessRequest) (updateParams types.AccessRequestUpdate, err error)

// Rather than automatically calling client requests, make the client callable within the handler.
type HandlerFunc func(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, req types.AccessRequest) (err error)
```

In my opinion, we might as well implement all three options. The higher level options will simply be wrappers around the low level option.

### Add Python Client

Once the protobuf schema has been detangled from the `teleport/lib` code, it should be easy to create a bare bones `python` version of the Auth client. Python will be the first langauge of many new client libary implementations.

```bash
ls github.com/gravitational/teleport
api/
python/

$ pip install teleport-client
```

```python
import teleport

client = teleport.client(addr=...)
client.tokens()
```

Port router code

```python
@access.handle(clt, path=access.trait("team")):
def handle(req):
   if req.user == "bob":
      raise access.Denied("access denied")
```

Update docs to include the `python` variant of the client as well.
